## Bio
I'm a first-year Bioengineering PhD student at Caltech, researching synthetic biology with [Erik Winfree](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/), and currently remotely enrolled from my home in Cambridge, UK. I graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge with a BA in Chemistry and an MSci in Systems Biology. 

I'm Interested in using synthetic biology to [understand life](https://doi.org/10.1038/468889a) and to build technologies which benefit humanity. I’ve long wanted to be a scientist, and have completed research projects every summer since turning 16. I won a Silver Medal at the International Biology Olympiad [in 2016](https://blog.rsb.org.uk/visiting-vietnam-for-the-international-biology-olympiad-2016/), and Gold Medals in the national Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Olympiads in 2015 & 16. I love
puzzles and crosswords, and represented Trinity in the Cambridge College Quiz. I love to travel and am fascinated by world history, and am lucky enough to have visited more than 40 countries. I’ve taken cooking classes in eight of them.

## Colophon
This site is written in html and [sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I first found the site's theme on [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/), and have since added quite a few personal touches. I fell in love with [Liquid templating](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) while adding them. The original theme was written by [Paul N Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul), who kindly put his work into the public domain using the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/). The font is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
