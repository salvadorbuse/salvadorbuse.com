## Bio
I'm a PhD student in Bioengineering at Caltech, researching synthetic biology, pattern formation, and biochemical neural networks with [Erik Winfree](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/). I graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge with a BA in Chemistry and an MSci in Systems Biology. 

I'm interested in using synthetic biology to [understand life](https://doi.org/10.1038/468889a) and to build technologies which benefit humanity. I’ve wanted to be a scientist for as long as I can remember: I've been doing summer research projects since I turned 16. I won a Silver Medal at the International Biology Olympiad [in 2016](https://blog.rsb.org.uk/visiting-vietnam-for-the-international-biology-olympiad-2016/), and Gold Medals in the national Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Olympiads in 2015 & 16. I love puzzles and crosswords, and represented Trinity in the Cambridge College Quiz. I love to travel and am fascinated by world history, and am lucky enough to have visited more than 40 countries. I’ve taken cooking classes in eight of them.

I care deeply about the long-term future of humanity, and consider myself part of the the [effective altruist](https://www.effectivealtruism.org) community. The century we are living in could be the [most important in humanity's history](https://www.cold-takes.com/the-most-important-century-in-a-nutshell/), and it is our responsibility to make sure that it goes well.

I first found the site's theme on [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/), and have since added some personal touches. I came to enjoy [Liquid templating](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) while adding them. The original theme was written by [Paul N Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul), who kindly put his work into the public domain using the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/). The font is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
