## Research Experience
#### California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
**PhD Rotation Student, [Erik Winfree Lab](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/)**, *Sep 2020 -*
* Researching pattern formation and morphogenesis in cellular automata. Currently working remotely from Cambridge, UK.

#### Laboratory of Molecular Biology
**Master's Thesis Student, [Jason Chin Lab](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/jason-chin/)**, *Nov 2019 - Apr 2020*
*  To enable bacteria to make proteins containing up to three unnatural amino acids, the Chin lab built ’Syn61’, an E. coli strain whose genome uses only 61 of 64 codons, and is the largest synthesised to date. This works by ’recoding’: synonymously replacing all instances of three codons. I found that Syn61 still contains some recoded codons, and and studied their implications for Syn61 and future recoded genomes.

**Medical Research Council Summer Student, [Jason Chin Lab](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/jason-chin/)**, *Jun 2019 - Sep 2019*
*  In Syn61, recoded codons are ‘blank’: they do not encode natural amino acids, so can be assigned to unnatural amino acids. First, however, the tRNAs recognising recoded codons must be removed. I deleted those tRNAs and found the new Syn61 strain to be viable, but less fit.

#### Stanford University, Department of Chemical and Systems Biology
**Summer Research Intern, [Jim Ferrell Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/ferrelllab/)**, *Jun 2018 - Aug 2018*
*  I studied the role of an APC/C subunit in cell cycle regulation using two approaches: first, finding interaction partners of the subunit in Xenopus egg extracts, and second, identifying any altered phenotypes in cultured human cells with mutant versions of the subunit.

#### University of Cambridge, Department of Physiology, Development, and Neuroscience
**Summer Research Intern, [Bill Harris Lab](https://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/directory/william-harris)**, *Jul 2017 - Sep 2017*
*  I used two‑photon microscopes to generate 3D time‑lapse movies of the retinas of developing zebrafish. I wrote code (in MATLAB) to extract data from those movies and analyse the motion of the cell nuclei, to study the role of nuclear migration in retinal development.

## Leadership
#### Cambridge University Scientific Society, [SciSoc](http://scisoc.com/)
**Co-President**, *Mar 2018 - Mar 2019*
* I arranged a weekly lecture series of 15 leading scientists, and co‑chaired a research internships event. I helped to renew our relationship with Oxford’s Science Society, and jointly arranged a formal dinner in Cambridge and a field trip to the London Natural History Museum. I did this together with my co-president, [Charlene](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleneostang/).

#### Trinity College Science Society, [TCSS](https://tcss.soc.srcf.net/)
**President**, *Mar 2017 - Mar 2018*
* I arranged a weekly lecture series of 17 pre‑eminent scientists, which featured Sir Paul Nurse & Dame Ottoline Leyser. I also organised a research internships event, which now occurs annually, and a symposium showcasing research at Trinity.
