You can find much more of my favourite music on my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/salvador.buse) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPHPCWozhDfSJrjBZGDp9DdSMRB_Gtq1d) [playlists](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPHPCWozhDfQEn18EoQj6-GXq8NeMnBYE). Probably most representative of what I listen to is my playlist [Rock Is Not Dead](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4lMNIgmEdxIjDVBzKypjT2), containing some favourite songs from rock bands (quite loosely defined) whose debut album is from 2010 or later. A strangely high fraction of this music [comes from Australia](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/00FFDC7KnG9MbqSopqUpXw).

I am tired of hearing people say that there is no good current rock music -- there is plenty! Nevertheless, I understand the mistake. The classic rock music that people enjoy comes from 30+ years ago, when rock was the most popular genre of music (unlike now). More significantly, older music has had more time to go through [cultural filtration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGPVJvHwXgQ). The good stuff from yore has been found and analysed and recommended by other people, has entered the popular conscious. One needs to put in more work to find today's good stuff; I am trying to contribute to this noble cause. May [King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com) be tomorrow's Pink Floyd!
